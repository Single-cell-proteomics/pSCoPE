### Requirements

This application has been tested on R >= 3.5.0, OSX 10.14 / Windows 7/8/10. R can be downloaded from the main [R Project page](https://www.r-project.org/) or downloaded with the [RStudio Application](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). All modules are maintained for MaxQuant >= 1.6.0.16.



### Running

Each thematic part of the SCoPE2_analysis.R script is bounded by an R "region". These can be minimized when not in use. You will need to create "figs","dat", and "code" sub-directories.
